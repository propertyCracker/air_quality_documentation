# Data Generation Module

The **Data Generation Module** simulates realistic air quality readings across multiple regions in Egypt.  
It is responsible for creating dynamic sensor data that mimics real-world environmental conditions, including:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- CO₂  
- NO₂  
- PM2.5  
- PM10  

This data is streamed to **Azure IoT Hub** and stored locally in daily log files for historical analysis.

## 1. Devices & Regions

Each simulated device is mapped to a region using devices.json and 
egions.json.  
The region defines:

- Latitude and longitude  
- Base readings for each pollutant  
- Activity end hour activity
