# Problem Statement

Egypt faces increasing challenges with air pollution and environmental degradation, particularly in urban and industrial areas. Existing monitoring systems often lack **real-time analysis**, **regional specificity**, and **interactive tools** for decision-makers.

This project addresses these challenges by:

- Simulating realistic air quality data for multiple regions in Egypt.
- Streaming the data to a centralized cloud system for storage and analytics.
- Providing **batch and streaming analysis** to track trends and identify problem areas.
- Enabling **natural language querying** via a Large Language Model, so government officials can easily access insights.
- Delivering interactive dashboards to support actionable decisions for **air quality improvement and environmental regulation enforcement**.

The ultimate goal is to provide the Egyptian government with a **reliable, scalable, and interactive system** to monitor and improve environmental conditions across the country.
