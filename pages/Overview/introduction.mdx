# Introduction

Air quality is a critical issue in Egypt, affecting public health, agriculture, and the environment. This project aims to support the **Egyptian Ministry of Environment** and other government authorities by providing a scalable, interactive system for monitoring air quality and environmental conditions.

The system simulates real-time air quality data across multiple regions, streams it to Azure IoT Hub, stores it in Azure Synapse Analytics, and provides both batch and streaming analysis through **Power BI dashboards**. Additionally, a custom **Large Language Model (LLM)** interface allows officials to query the data using natural language, making the system easy to use and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

By combining simulation, cloud storage, advanced analytics, and natural language querying, this project provides a **practical tool to support decision-making and improve environmental monitoring in Egypt**.
