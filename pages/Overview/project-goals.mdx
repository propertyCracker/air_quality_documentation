# Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to **support the Egyptian government in monitoring air quality and protecting the environment**. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. **Data Simulation**: Generate realistic, dynamic air quality readings across multiple regions in Egypt to mimic real-world conditions.
2. **Data Ingestion & Storage**: Stream the generated data to Azure IoT Hub and store it efficiently in Azure Synapse Analytics for easy access and analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Enable both batch and streaming analysis for key environmental metrics and trends using Power BI.
4. **Interactive Querying**: Implement a Large Language Model (LLM) interface that allows government officials and analysts to query data using natural language commands.
5. **Visualization**: Provide clear, interactive dashboards that help decision-makers track air quality trends, identify problem areas, and take preventive measures.
6. **Support Environmental Policies**: Offer actionable insights to assist the Egyptian government in enforcing environmental regulations and improving air quality management.

By achieving these goals, this project provides a **practical, scalable, and interactive solution** to help Egypt monitor and improve environmental conditions effectively.
