Each simulated device is mapped to a region using devices.json and regions.json, defining latitude/longitude, base readings, and activity end hour. 
```json 
{ 
  "device_1": { 
    "region_name": "Cairo", 
    "lat": 30.0444, 
    "lon": 31.2357, 
    "temperature": 28.0, 
    "humidity": 50.0, 
    "co2": 400, 
    "no2": 20, 
    "pm25": 15, 
    "pm10": 25, 
    "activity_end": 22 
  } 
}
