# What can we do?
The LLM acts as a smart assistant that understands plain-language questions and turns 
them into useful insights from your air-quality dataset.
Instead of users needing SQL, dashboards, or technical tools, 
they can just ask questions like:
```
“Show me the highest CO₂ levels in Cairo today.”
“What region has the worst air quality this week?”
“Compare air quality between Alexandria and Giza this month.”
“Is there any dangerous pollution trend right now?”
“Summarize the last 24 hours of air quality.”
```
The LLM reads the user’s question → understands the intent → fetches or computes the correct answer using your project's data → returns a clean, human-readable explanation.
