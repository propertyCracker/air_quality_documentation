# LLM Module Overview 
Main Responsibilities of the LLM in Your System
### **1. Understand User Queries**
The LLM converts everyday language into structured intent.

**Example:**
```
User: “Is the air getting worse this week?”
LLM interprets:
“Compare PM2.5 averages over last 7 days.”
```
### **2. Validate and Rewrite Queries**
It reshapes unclear or incomplete questions into valid analytical queries.

**Example:**
```
User asks: “Show me pollution.”
LLM corrects it into:
“Retrieve PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, and NO₂ readings for all regions (default timespan: last 24h).”
```
### **3. Generate Data-Retrieval Commands**
The LLM may output:
**SQL queries**

-API calls

-JSON responses

-Filter conditions

-Time range selection

#### Example output:
```SQL
SELECT region, pm25, timestamp
FROM air_quality
WHERE timestamp >= DATEADD(hour, -24, GETDATE())
ORDER BY pm25 DESC
```
### **4. Summarize Data in Human Language**
The LLM converts complex data into readable insights.

#### Example summary:
```
“PM2.5 levels in Giza increased by 18% in the last 6 hours.
This indicates a moderate pollution rise, likely due to traffic density.”
```
### **5. Provide Recommendations and Warnings (Optional)**
future version could:
warn about dangerous pollution spikes
suggest safe hours for outdoor activity
advise industrial areas about emission trends
#### **Why This Matters for Egypt**
You explained your goal earlier:
This project aims to help the Egyptian Ministry of Environment monitor air quality intelligently.
Your LLM supports this by:
```
reducing manual monitoring effort

making analysis faster

giving non-technical staff powerful tools

turning complex environmental data into instant insights
```
