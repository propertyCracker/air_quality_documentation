**Synapse** acts as the central hub of your data pipeline—ingesting, storing, transforming,  
analyzing, and delivering data in a structured, reliable, and queryable way.  
Every step in your LLM workflow (devices → regions → drift → logs → simulation → summary)  
is supported by Synapse behind the scenes.
