# Data Processing & Storage
We use Azure Synapse Analytics because it acts as the central data processing engine for 
the air quality monitoring system.
It ingests data from IoT Hub, stores it in a scalable SQL pool, applies
ETL transformations, and prepares analytical tables.
Power BI then connects to Synapse to visualize the cleaned and aggregated data.
Synapse enables both batch and streaming analytics, making it essential for
handling continuous IoT sensor data before sending it to Power BI dashboards.
